			<h2 class="title mb-0 position-relative onwhitetitle mb-2">Why is Canada the perfect place to study abroad?</h2>
			
			<ul class="check-square  mb-20 ">
				<li>Academic Excellence</li>
				<p>One of the most important reasons why students choose to study in Canada is because of the high quality of education. When a student receives a degree from a Canadian university, it acts as a mark of trust and excellence. 26 of Canada's universities rank in the <a href="https://www.idp.com/india/qs-ranking-of-canadian-university/">QS World University</a> Rankings 2019 and 27 of them in the <a href="https://www.idp.com/india/qs-ranking-of-canadian-university/">THE World University Rankings 2019.</a></li>

				<li>Affordable, Falls In Budget</li>
				<p>Tuition fee in Canada, when compared to universities in the US and UK, is fairly cheaper. And when considering the return on investment, it is quite a viable option for Indian students. ??You can also apply to a range of scholarships to cut down on your educational expenses.</p>
				<li>Cultural Diversity</li>
				<p>In Canada, you’ll find extremely warm and welcoming people who come from varied ethnic groups with different cultures and lifestyle. The multicultural environment in Canada promotes friendliness and peaceful living like no other country. In fact, you will find a lot of Indians studying, working and living here.</p>
				<li>Safe & Peaceful</li>
				<p>Canada has been consistently ranked as one of the safest nations in the world. In 2018, the Global Peace Index*, listed Canada as the sixth peaceful country across the globe. As international student, you’ll enjoy the same rights as any other Canadian.</p>
				<li>Earn While You Learn</li>
				<p>Thanks to its special regulations, Canada provides all its international students with an opportunity to work for up to 20 hours every week during their semesters and full-time during the summer and winter breaks. To work on-campus or as an intern in any company, you would not require any additional work permit as your study permit is enough to help you find a part time job.
